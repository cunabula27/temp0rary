# temp0rary

New to Github as of today, so I expect I'm going to be adding and deleting things from here with no rhyme or reason until I know what I'm doing.

Collecting here openFrameworks projects for the VJing side of temp0rary.

TestCard is an initial sketch for me to work on learning oF and C++ and integration with both Spout and Midi triggers.
